# Keemap-Blender-Rig-ReTargeting-Addon
Blender Rig Retargeting Addon allows mapping motions of one rig to another.  Works with ANY rig and allows user to map bones from one rig to another and save mapping files out to hard drive.  This script is tested and working on blender 2.83, if a newer version of blender breaks the script I'm sorry.

Installation Procedure:
Download the zip file in the root folder NOT the entire source code tree.  Go to Blender-->edit(pull down from menus at top)--> Preferences, then click on the add ons button on the left of the ui.  Click on the Install button.  Select the zip file you have downloaded.  When the script shows up on the list check the box to enable it.

UI:

In the above image is the UI for the GUI in blender when the script is installed.

Starting Frame: When the 'Transfer Animation from Source to Destination Character' button is pressed this is the starting frame in the timeline to start applying the rig modifications from the source to the destination.
